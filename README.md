### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You can call me **Rosid**, I'm software engineer from Indonesia with focus on Backend Engineering.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust

Despite knowing Rust since 2019 and beginning to work on my project in 2022, I've only been using it since then. Here are a few open source Rust projects.

- [hl](https://github.com/ahmadrosid/hl) - Github-like html Syntax highlighting generator.
- [tpd](https://github.com/ahmadrosid/tpd) - Typo Detector for English words.
- [json-list](https://github.com/ahmadrosid/json-list) - Take json list turn to striing list.
