### Hi there 👋

You can call me **Rosid**, I'm software engineer from Indonesia with focus on Backend Engineering with 7 years of experience.

### 👯 Programming Language

As a Backend Developer, I use a variety of programming languages, but I am most proficient in Javascript/Typescript, Golang, PHP. Furthermore, I am looking to work with Rust, which is currently my favorite language.

### 🔭 Side Project

Search Engine has been of interest to me since last year. The first search engine I used was Elasticsearch, which I use at work. However, on my project, I decided to use Apache Solr, since I find it to be easier to use. Currently I'm working on Codesearch, which teaches me about inverted index and search engines such as Lucene and Solr.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust

Despite knowing Rust since 2019 and beginning to work on my project since January 2022, I've only been using it since then. Here are a few open source Rust projects.

- [hl](https://github.com/ahmadrosid/hl) - Github-like html Syntax highlighting.
- [tpd](https://github.com/ahmadrosid/tpd) - Typo Detector for English words.
- [json-list](https://github.com/ahmadrosid/json-list) - Take json list turn to striing list.
- [npr](https://github.com/ahmadrosid/npr) - Find and execute npm script.
- [faker-cli](https://github.com/ahmadrosid/faker-cli) - Generate fake data from your terminal.
